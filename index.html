      <h1>The Dark Web</h1>
      <div id="info">
        <p>
          This visualization explores anonymity on the highly connected Dark
          Web. Although sites on the darknet offer to protect the privacy of
          their visitors and owner, administrators can inadvertently leak
          details that put everyone at risk. Staying anonymous on the so-called
          dark web is hard. Even the most seasoned Darknet administrators like
          OxyMonster, can make one small mistake and be done for it.
        </p>
        <p>
          This visualization use OnionScan to scan 8,176 .onion
          <span class="hidden-service">hidden services</span>
          on the Tor anonymity network and gather various identifying metadata
          associated with them. We use this metadata in various ways within the
          hive table to explore relationships and patterns between hidden
          services using identity correlations such as
          <span class="ip-address">IP addresses</span>,
          <span class="ssh-key">SSH keys</span>,
          <span class="pgp-key">PGP key fingerprints</span>, related
          <span class="clearnet-service">Clearnet sites</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          These identities are positionally encoded on their own axes. Hidden
          services are positioned according to their weighted security score
          based on found keys, Apache mod_status leak, open directories, bitcoin
          addresses and server fingerprints. Clearnet sites are positional
          encoded based on degree and IP addresses are grouped by Class A.
